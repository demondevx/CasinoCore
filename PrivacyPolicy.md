# CasinoCore Privacy Policy

_Last updated: November 10, 2025_

We respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how **CasinoCore** (“the Bot”, “we”, “us”) collects, uses, and protects data when you invite or interact with the Bot. By using CasinoCore, you consent to the practices described below.

---

## 1. Information We Collect
We collect only the data necessary to provide the Bot’s functionality:

### 1.1 Discord Metadata
- Discord user IDs, usernames, discriminators, and avatars (as provided by the Discord API)
- Guild IDs, channel IDs, role IDs, and related server configuration data

### 1.2 Economy & Gameplay Data
- User balances (cash, bank, investments, loans)
- Store items, inventory contents, transaction logs, command history, cooldown timers
- Custom messages, item descriptions, and configuration values set via commands

### 1.3 Premium & Support Data
- Premium activation records (server ID, user ID, duration, source)
- Vote-based premium records (Top.gg webhook payloads)
- Support requests or bug reports submitted through official channels

We **do not** collect raw message content except for the message metadata needed to process chat-money rewards. We do not log or store direct messages unless explicitly sent to the bot for support.

---

## 2. How We Use the Data
- Provide and maintain economy, casino, and store features
- Enforce cooldowns, limits, and security checks (e.g., audit logs, anomaly detection)
- Generate analytics and visual reports for premium features
- Grant and track premium access, voting rewards, and DM notifications
- Diagnose issues, combat abuse, and improve the Bot

We do not sell or share user data with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.

---

## 3. Data Storage & Retention
- Data is stored in secure databases hosted by the Bot operators.
- Economy backups you create through `/backup` commands are stored until deleted by you or the retention limit is reached.
- Inactive servers may have their data purged after an extended period (e.g., 90 days of inactivity).
- Transaction logs and audit records are retained for moderation and safety; server owners can request deletion if the server removes the Bot.

---

## 4. Security
We implement reasonable security measures (restricted access, authentication, regular updates) to protect Bot data. However, no system is perfectly secure. You are responsible for controlling who can run admin commands in your server.

---

## 5. Third-Party Services
- **Discord**: All interactions occur via the Discord API, governed by Discord’s own policies.
- **Top.gg**: Optional voting rewards require Top.gg webhook integration.
- **PM2 / Hosting Providers**: Infrastructure providers may process log files for uptime and error monitoring.

Each service is subject to its own privacy practices.

---

## 6. Your Choices & Rights
- Remove the Bot from your server to stop further data collection.
- Use admin commands to delete or reset economy data (e.g., `/reset-economy`, `/backup delete`).
- Request data deletion by contacting the developers via the support server, including proof of server ownership.
- Configure audit channels and store content responsibly; avoid storing personal data in custom fields.

---

## 7. Children’s Privacy
CasinoCore is intended for communities that meet Discord’s minimum age requirement (13+ or as required by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we discover such data, we will delete it promptly.

---

## 8. International Users
Data may be processed and stored in countries different from your own. By using CasinoCore, you consent to the transfer and processing of data in the jurisdictions where our infrastructure is located.

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Significant changes will be announced via the support server or repository changelog. Continued use of the Bot after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.

---

## 10. Contact Us
For privacy inquiries, data removal, or questions about these practices:
- Join the official support server (see `/help` or `/premium-info`).
- Provide your server ID and details about the request.

We aim to respond within a reasonable timeframe.

By using CasinoCore, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.
